 The SaaS model

When you think about SaaS, it's an amazing business model. If you're drawn to SaaS, bravo for you. I like to think about it as a better version of pharmaceuticals.

Think about Viagra, a billion dollars to create that first pill. But thereafter, it maybe costs two cents to create a pill that they can then sell for $2 or $3. A very high margin and oftentimes, in pharmaceutical, we get recurring revenue.
Different kinds of pills in a variety of colors

SaaS is even better. Software is much cheaper to build, and it scales very, very nicely. So if you can find a good SaaS business, and you can figure out how you can scale it, then you're going to have something pretty magical.
Pricing

From my perspective, pricing should be an exercise you engage in before you even start building a product. It doesn't mean you're going to land on a number or a set of numbers or anything else. But at the very least, you want to start thinking about the model.
Questions to ask yourself

You've got to wonder:

    Who's going to buy my product?
    Am I selling this to individuals?
    Are they going to be paying on a recurring basis?
    Am I selling it to businesses?
    What part of the business? 
 
 
 Validation is key

The most important thing early on in the SaaS business is going to be validation. You need some people to use and pay for your product, extracting the maximum amount of revenue from them is really a secondary concern. Maybe not even a secondary concern, it's probably not a concern at all.

Think about how large your market is and if you're selling a product for $10 million a year versus $10 a month, you're serving different markets, those markets should be different sizes.

Are you going to be very engaged in the selling of your product, or is it going to be more of a product-led growth, people can sign up, put in a credit card, and it's automated?

Once they're engaged, how much time are you spending supporting, expanding, and all that kind of stuff? These are the things you need to think about as you're building your product, as you're thinking about the business before you can even get to the price.

Because if you don't answer these questions, at least in your own head, pricing is going to be effectively an impossibly challenging exercise.
Key metrics/terminology

Let's talk about some of the numbers you're going to end up focusing on, you're going to want to try to the extent possible to build out or at least model this in some vague way as you are thinking about your business.

Again, it's not about nailing it the first time, it's about really understanding what it is, getting directionally close, and then making the refinements as you go. 


Pricing and product

What are the things that are going to influence price?

Things that influence price

    Competition coming into the market.
    Commoditization, aka, this tool is just readily available.
    Product rot - If you are not actively working on your product, you might not be able to charge as much for it.
    Maybe your existing customers are locked in, but if the rest of the market is passing you by because you're not actively improving what you offer, then you will not be able to charge as much.
    Misfocused - If you're focused on the wrong stuff, you're solving problems A, B, and C, but people are willing to pay a lot more money for D, E, and F, it's going to hurt your pricing.
    Then also if the problem set changes or disappears. If you're selling year 2000 software to help with the transition from 1999 to 2000, that market effectively disappeared literally overnight.

On the other side:

    If you establish market leadership.
    More high-value features - If you are investing in more features that are addressing specific pain for people.
    Growing problem - If the problem in the market is growing, a great example of a growth market over the last year and a half is remote conferences and software to power them.
    Building an ecosystem, so other people are tethered into your product.
    And also criticality, how hard is it for someone to let go of this?
